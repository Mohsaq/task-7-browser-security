# Task 7 – Browser Security: Managing Extensions

## 🎯 Objective
Review installed browser extensions, identify potential risks, remove unnecessary or suspicious extensions, and document security best practices.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Google Chrome (latest version on Windows 11)  
- Built-in Extensions Manager  

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed
1. Opened Chrome → Menu → **Extensions → Manage Extensions**.  
2. Reviewed all installed extensions one by one.  
3. Checked permissions (e.g., access to browsing history, clipboard, websites).  
4. Identified unused or unnecessary extensions.  
5. Removed extensions that were not required.  
6. Restarted the browser to confirm they were removed successfully.  

---

## 📊 Observations
- Some extensions requested **excessive permissions** (e.g., “Read and change all data on websites”).  
- Extensions not updated frequently can become a **security risk**.  
- Removing unused extensions reduced clutter and improved browser speed.

## 🛡 Security Risks of Malicious Extensions
- Can **steal saved passwords** and personal data.  
- May **inject ads or redirect traffic** to malicious websites.  
- Could log keystrokes (**keylogger behavior**).  
- Some extensions perform **cryptojacking** (using CPU for mining).

## 🔑 Best Practices for Safe Extension Use
1. Only install extensions from **trusted sources** (Chrome Web Store, Mozilla Add-ons).  
2. Check **permissions** before installing – avoid those with full access unless necessary.  
3. Read user **reviews and ratings**.  
4. Keep extensions **updated**.  
5. Remove extensions that are not actively used.  
6. Enable only the **minimum number** of extensions needed.
